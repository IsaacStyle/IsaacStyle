### Hi there 👋

![Literally Me](https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wholesome-cute-duck-pics-5da04713f2775__700.jpg)

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in building mostly webstack application. I love a good challenge and I actively hunt for struggle... which may or may not be a sign of masochism but lets not dwell on that. I am passionate about helping others, learning and expanding my knowledge as much as possible and coding helps fulfil this desire within myself.

My current skillset includes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Node.js, Mongodb, Mongoose, Express, React, OpenAI, 

Currently I'm working on a MERN (Mongodb, Express, React, Node) stack application with full CRUD (Create, Edit, Update, Delete) functionality with a team of talented developers.
