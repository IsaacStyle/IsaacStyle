### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Literally Me]([https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wholesome-cute-duck-pics-5da04713f2775__700.jpg](https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/iStock_000002573103_George-Clerk-602x400.jpg))

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in building mostly webstack application. I love a good challenge and I actively hunt for struggle... which may or may not be a sign of masochism but lets not dwell on that. I am passionate about helping others, learning and expanding my knowledge as much as possible and coding helps fulfil this desire within myself.

My current skillset includes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Node.js, Mongodb, Mongoose, Express, React, OpenAI, Postgresql, and Django.

Currently I'm working on a Social Media application using Postgresql and Django as its backend, and using React for its Frontend. The goal is to have full CRUD (Create, Edit, Update, Delete) functionality acccessible only with User Authentication. This projec is being done with a team of talented developers.
