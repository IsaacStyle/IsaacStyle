### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in building mostly webstack application. I love a good challenge and I actively hunt for struggle... which may or may not be a sign of masochism but lets not dwell on that. I am passionate about helping others, learning and expanding my knowledge as much as possible and coding helps fulfil this desire within myself.

Currently I'm working on a MERN (Mongodb, Express, React, Node) stack application with full CRUD (Create, Edit, Update, Delete) functionality with a team of talented developers.
